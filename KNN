[1] Load Iris CSV
Use pandas.read_csv() to load the Iris dataset, which includes flower measurements and species names.
This step brings data into memory for analysis and modeling.
If the file lacks column headers, they will be added in the next step.
This is a common starting point in classification problems.

[2] Add Headers (if needed)
If the dataset lacks column names, manually assign headers like ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'class'].
Proper headers make data easier to interpret and manipulate.
This ensures the dataset has meaningful column names for later steps.
It's essential for clean and readable code.

[3] Extract Features (X) and Target (y)
Split the dataset into input features X (first four columns) and target y (flower species).
Use df.iloc[:, :-1] for features and df.iloc[:, -1] for the target.
This step prepares the data for training a classifier.
X holds the measurements; y holds the class labels.

[4] Encode Target Classes to Numeric Labels
Use pd.factorize() to convert categorical class labels (e.g., 'setosa') into numeric values.
This is needed because machine learning models require numerical inputs.
The model will now work with integers like 0, 1, 2 instead of strings.
This step also preserves mapping for later decoding.

[5] Train/Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
The training set teaches the model, while the test set is used for evaluation.
This prevents overfitting and ensures the model works on unseen data.
The split is usually 70/30 or 80/20 depending on dataset size.

[6] For Each Test Point:
Loop through each test point and:
→ Calculate the Euclidean distance between the test point and every training point
→ Sort the distances in ascending order
→ Select the top k (e.g., 8) nearest neighbors
→ Use majority voting among neighbors to assign a predicted label
This is the core logic of KNN — a lazy learning algorithm.

[7] Compare Predictions with True Labels
Match predicted labels against the actual test labels to count correct predictions.
This helps in calculating the model’s classification accuracy.
A simple loop can tally the number of correct outputs.
It gives insight into the model’s performance.

[8] Compute Accuracy and Confusion Matrix
Use accuracy_score() to compute the overall accuracy percentage.
Use confusion_matrix() to see how many predictions were correct for each class.
This matrix shows true positives, false positives, and class-wise errors.
It’s a detailed way to evaluate classification results.
